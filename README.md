# Lab0

Starter code for Lab 0 

Your task is to create a new file titled "MyCode" (without the quotation marks of course). This file should contain a line or two of something interesting (about you, your goals, your life; completely upto you). The assignment is complete when you successfully manage to push this file onto your repository for Lab 0 on Github.
